# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-CNN-based-Feature-Extraction
Pneumonia is a life-threatening infectious disease
affecting one or both lungs in humans commonly caused by
bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. One in three deaths
in India is caused due to pneumonia as reported by World
Health Organization (WHO). Chest X-Rays which are used to
diagnose pneumonia need expert radiotherapists for
evaluation. Thus, developing an automatic system for detecting
pneumonia would be beneficial for treating the disease without
any delay particularly in remote areas. Due to the success of
deep learning algorithms in analyzing medical images,
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained much
attention for disease classification. In addition, features learned
by pre-trained CNN models on large-scale datasets are much
useful in image classification tasks. In this work, we appraise
the functionality of pre-trained CNN models utilized as
feature-extractors followed by different classifiers for the
classification of abnormal and normal chest X-Rays. We
analytically determine the optimal CNN model for the purpose.
Statistical results obtained demonstrates that pretrained CNN
models employed along with supervised classifier algorithms
can be very beneficial in analyzing chest X-ray images,
specifically to detect Pneumonia.
